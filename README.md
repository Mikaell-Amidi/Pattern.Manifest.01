# Pattern.Manifest.01
This repository provides 15 generic implmentation with concerete examples which inspired by GOF.

* Module.001-Visitor
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

![module-001](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/a471b3b4-1190-4fbc-a11c-7475bc6366a4)

* Module.002-Factory
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

![module-002](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/6a4a39f0-ed58-498f-98cc-8bbd9be01818)

* Module.003-Decorator
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

![module-003](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/65d7201f-b9e3-4d1f-8e1b-5cf151686618)

* Module.004-Monad
Monad is a way of chaining operations on the given object together step by step.
In Validator each step results in either success or failure indicator to get the validated object or list of exceptions.

![module-004](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/ad02175d-10c8-435f-a5dd-00db019f4ec9)

* Module.005-Facade
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

![module-005](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/3b56f289-d1de-4c2f-b030-b47abbb64d59)

* Module.006-ConditionalStrategyFactory
Monad is a way of chaining operations on the given object together step by step.
In Validator each step results in either success or failure indicator to get the validated object or list of exceptions.

![module-006](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/ab5e63dd-dcbb-4c21-b8a9-9cf3b1b5ee41)

* Module.007-Flyweight
A flyweight is a shared object that can be used in multiple contexts simultaneously.
The flyweight acts as an independent object in each context.
It’s indistinguishable from an instance of the object that’s not shared.
Flyweights cannot make assumptions about the context in which they operate.

![module-007](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/1f0c44bc-a064-46da-bb60-5079be32da58)

* Module.008-Bridge
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

![module-008](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/fc333003-3804-4d49-8379-d7e3bbe7787c)

* Module.009-Strategy
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently by clients that use it.

![module-009](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/56736262-c79d-44f1-92ce-b5aec3d3b380)

* Module-010-Template
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation,deferring some steps to subclasses.
Template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm’s structure.

![module-010](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/6cf25b14-935a-413a-b35e-2de310ec1bde)

* Module-011-Command
Encapsulate a request as an object.
Letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queues, or log requests, and supports undoable operations.

![module-011](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/72365fcb-538a-4222-b0cd-087907f0b834)

* Module-012-Validator
Provides an architecture for securing and inspecting objects based on given conditions.
Returning inspected object or triggers an event upon inspection failure.

![module-012](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/58aa3c97-f723-48b7-8235-1cc5b97ca8e6)

* Module-013-Iterator
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

![module-013](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/53c13cd7-7e6b-43df-be10-69c9780cad65)

* Module-014-Adopter
Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.
Adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

![module-014](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/7ad845fc-5dbb-4cc7-a95a-1616bb7d9069)

* Module-015-Memento
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object’s internal state.
So that the object can be restored to this state later.

![module-015](https://github.com/Mikaell-Amidi/Pattern.Manifest.01/assets/82368245/c8f8a1f6-7bb5-4721-90c2-9765c5058d21)
