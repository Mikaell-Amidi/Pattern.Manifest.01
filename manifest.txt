module.001-VisitorPattern
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

module.002-FactoryPattern
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

module.003-DecoratorPattern
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

module.004-MonadPattern
Monad is a way of chaining operations on the given object together step by step.
In Validator each step results in either success or failure indicator to get the validated object or list of exceptions.


module.005-Facade
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

module.006-ConditionalStrategyFactory
Monad is a way of chaining operations on the given object together step by step.
In Validator each step results in either success or failure indicator to get the validated object or list of exceptions.

module.007-Flyweight
A flyweight is a shared object that can be used in multiple contexts simultaneously.
The flyweight acts as an independent object in each context.
It’s indistinguishable from an instance of the object that’s not shared.
Flyweights cannot make assumptions about the context in which they operate.

module.008-Bridge
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

module.009-Strategy
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently by clients that use it.
